# symfony

Following are the project instructions given by sir Waqas Mahmood 


Assignment:
I need you to implement ACL.. expected functionalities would be to have a blog backend admin panel
- Login
- Roles Implementation (Super Admin, Admin, Editor, Viewer.. )
- Posts CRUD
- Authors CRUD
- Comments

I need only admin panel super admin can create and assign roles to different users and user can log in and do their stuff like
if an admin logs in -> he can create/update/delete list posts, authors, and everything related to the blog
if the editor log in -> he can update posts related to stuff
if viewer logs in -> he can view all the listing etc
Don't want design and stuff to be complicated.. keep it simple in design

I will review your progress on daily basis. Meanwhile, you can contact me anytime if you face any issues.
